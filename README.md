# React Node Journal App

This app was created for me to practice full stack development using React and Node. It's a simple journal app that utilises DraftJS as the text editor.

The application is hosted [here](https://react-node-journal.herokuapp.com). I will be using this application to write down my weekly reflections during my internship at Horangi from Jun - Dec 2022.
